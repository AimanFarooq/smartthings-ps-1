How to set up a custom device



You need IDE access. https://graph.api.smartthings.com/

go into my device types https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/devices

click + New SmartDevice

fill out just name, namespace and author and click create

copy and paste the code 

Click the save button

Click the publish button, for me

Go to My Devices

click + Add New Devices

Give it the following:
Name = anything you want
device Network Id = unique id (should be the hex IP and hex port of the device but my code will auto insert that when you set the ip and take a photo)
Type = Generic Camera Device
Version = Published
Location = your location
hub = your hub
group = what folder do you want the "thing" in, none is the default.

then click create
